I am a computational/spatial ecologist interested in understanding how anthropogenic changes such as climate and land-use change affect global ecosystems, and how this in turn affects human well-being. 

I am particularly interested in using novel statistical methods and heterogeneous sources of data to answer applied and theoretical questions. I was previously a mathematician and database developer, and apply skills learned there to answer ecological questions. 

I am currently working at the University of Birmingham in the role of Birmingham Fellow. The first three years of this will be spent working on the IIASA-NERC funded project *A complex-systems approach to improve understanding of the biodiversity-landscape structure relationship*.
